The SAM is a major influence on Southern Hemisphere climate, and has impacts on storm tracks, drought, and ice melt. Understanding its past variations can help characterize its behavior and predict its response to future climate change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LGM Reconstructions</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/lgm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/lgm/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re using data assimilation to constrain climate reconstructions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Check out &lt;a href="../../publication/5-lgm-sst">Jess Tierney&amp;rsquo;s paper&lt;/a>, which uses reconstructed SSTs at the LGM to constrain ECS, and &lt;a href="../../publication/p3-lgm-surface-t">Matt Osman&amp;rsquo;s new reconstruction&lt;/a> of surface temperatures from the LGM to present.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mt. Wylly Collection</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/tas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/tas/</guid><description>&lt;p>In December 2019, I helped with a Tasmanian tree-ring sampling effort led by Kathy Allen on the slopes of Mt. Wylly. We sampled a mix of live and dead trees, but were particularly searching for fossil wood records to help extend tree ring chronologies over the last several millennia. These tree ring records can help reconstruct regional climate effects and the Southern Annular Mode.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volcanic Assimilations</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/volcanism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/volcanism/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re using data assimilation to examine the sensitivity of the climate system to volcanic eruptions throughout the Common Era. Check out Feng Zhu&amp;rsquo;s recent papers &lt;a href="../../publication/4-Volcanic-DA">probing discrepancies between reconstructions and models&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="../../publication/P2-Volcanoes-ENSO">testing the ENSO response to volcanism&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DASH</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/dash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/dash/</guid><description>&lt;p>DASH is a Matlab package that facilitates paleoclimate data assimilation workflows. It includes utilities to build and organize state vectors, estimate proxy values using proxy system models (PSMs), and implement Ensemble Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, and Optimal Sensor tests. It has been used to implement a number of &lt;a href="../../tag/studies-using-dash">recent scientific studies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github Workshop</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/github-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/github-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>This workshop is designed to introduce scientists and academic reseachers to the Github platform. It covers fundamental git concepts (such as cloning, pushing, and branches), and provides demos showing how to implement common tasks using Github Desktop and the online Github website. This tutorial was a product of the &lt;a href="https://new.library.arizona.edu/ds2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Scholarship and Data Science Fellowship&lt;/a> at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Research Bazaar 2021</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/resbaz/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/resbaz/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an instructor for Research Bazaar (Resbaz) 2021 at the University of Arizona. Resbaz is a week-long series of workshops teaching data science skills. Topics include starting with Python, R, git, Bash, Latex, and more. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in attending, follow &lt;a href="https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/resbaz/resbazTucson2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link&lt;/a> to see the schedule and register.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Science Ambassador</title><link>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/dsa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jonathan-king.netlify.app/project/dsa/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a data science ambassador for the College of Science at the University of Arizona. If you are a member of the CoS and are looking for resources or help implementing data science for your research, please get in touch!
