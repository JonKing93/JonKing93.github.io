We're reconstructing the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) over the Common Era by applying data assimilation to drought atlases and the PAGES network of temperature sensitive climate proxies. The SAM is a major influence on Southern Hemisphere climate, and has impacts on storm tracks, drought, and ice melt. Understanding its past variations can help characterize its behavior and predict its response to future climate change.
