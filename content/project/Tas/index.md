In December 2019, I helped with a tree-ring sampling effort led by Kathy Allen on Mt. Wylly Tasmania. We sampled a mix of live and dead trees, but were particularly searching for fossil wood records to help extend tree ring chronologies over the last several millennia. These tree ring records can help reconstruct regional climate effects and the Southern Annular Mode.
