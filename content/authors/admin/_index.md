I'm a data scientist and PhD candidate in Geoscience who specializes in using data assimilation techniques to reconstruct past climates. My research focuses on combining natural climate archives, like tree-rings and ice-cores, with general circulation climate models. I also teach data science skills workshops for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and the University of Arizona to help promote open, reproducible science.
