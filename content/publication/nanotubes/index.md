abstract: "In this work, we report the first evidence of the direct growth of zinc sulfide nanotubes in an electric arc discharge. The synthesized material was characterized using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In addition to the experimental effort, the morphology of the capped nanotube was studied computationally at the PW91/DZ level of theory and compared to that of the material obtained experimentally."

summary: We synthesize and characterize zinc sulfide nanotubes.
